/**
 *  Manages verifying stored user sessions on a daily basis. This class depends on the Kit lifecycle
 *  and `UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification` event and checks whether the last verified
 *  time has exceeded a day based on UTC date boundaries. Note that this does not mean we will aggressively
 *  verify the second day of someone that started using the app at 11:59P and continues past 12:00A
 *  due to 1) avoiding load spike to backend and 2) there is no good reliable way to randomize the
 *  scheduling of the second verification due to constraints of iOS. Last verified time is only stored in memory
 *  to minimize overhead on the host application. Verification is done on a best effort basis and we
 *  will not retry if the network call fails for whatever reason.
